## Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: Recommended 1200px width or larger
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or similar landscape orientation works best

## How to Add Images

1. Download or prepare your image files
2. Rename them to match the filenames listed above
3. Place them in this `src/assets/images/` directory
4. The carousel will automatically use these local images

## Alternative: Using Different Image Names

If you want to use different image names, update the `src/assets/images/index.ts` file to match your actual filenames.
